		I saw some Bruma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
		<p>
		<blockquote>
			Passing cars,<br>
			When yuou cant see ,<br>
			May get you ,A glipose, <br>
			of eretnity.<br>
		</blockquote>
		</p>
		I definitely won't be passing any cars.

		My first day of the trip!I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a Segway,Iwasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:cell phone,ipop,digital camera, and a protein bar.Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,<q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Sgway.</q>
